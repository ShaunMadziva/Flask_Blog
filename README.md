# Flask_Blog
# A web app built with Flask, which has User authentication and allows Users to add content with full CRUD functionality.

# Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
# It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. This makes it easy to get started.
